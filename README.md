**Colors+** is a Tool for creating and editing a custom Window Overlay with Text and Images.  
It can be used for many purposes like streaming or reducing eyestrain.  
The Tool was tested with Windows 10 but should also work with Windows 11.  
  

## Documentation

**Please Read the Instructions with care to avoid breaking something**  
  
The Tool itself is structured into two main segments:  
1. The Main Settings Window where you can edit the Overlay.
2. The Overlay itself.
  
**Also the Tool may be flagged as a false positive by your System.**
**If you are still unsure please check and compile the Source Code yourself or try it in a VM first!**

### Use Cases

Here are some situations where I use this Tool:  

Making a bright Screen without Brightness Controll darker when working late at night.  

Showing text notes on screen above all Windows to keep track of something (Used together with Color transparency).  

Attaching the Overlay to any Window for individual configurations (Use [WinEdit Dx](https://github.com/EthernalStar/WinEdit-Dx) for obtaining the Window Handles).  

The Possibilities of using this Tool for useful or unuseful things are endless.  
  

### Building

There should not be any Problem building the Application because it does not rely on any external installed Packages.  
To build the Project you need to have the Lazarus IDE Version 2.2.6 installed and clone this Repository to yor local Machine.  
Now just open the .lpr file in your Lazarus Installation and you should be able to edit and compile the Project.  
  

## Issues

If you have multiple Monitors configured and change the color of the Overlay while it is above multiple screens the color may get messed up.  
To fix this just use the "Fix Color on Multi Monitor Setup" Button on the Color Page.  
  

## Planned Features

Currently there are a few Features planned for the Future like adding GIFs with animations to the Overlay or Saving Configurations.
